# ðŸª´ Local Plants - Theme

This package provides core theme state management without platform-specific code.  
Itâ€™s designed to work across web and native by letting each platform provide its own:

- Storage adapters
- System theme detection
- Style application
- Animations

It contains the predefined color schemes (stone, blue, green, purple, orange, red)  
and supports system, light, and dark modes.

All colors are defined in [src/colors.ts](./src/colors.ts).
