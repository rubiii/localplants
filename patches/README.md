## @bam.tech/react-native-image-resizer

Since Expo 54, iOS dependencies get precompiled which causes problems  
with RCT-Folly no longer being available as a source pod.

Last commit was 11 months ago so this will probably not get fixed.  
Jazz now also supports `expo-image-manipulator` so we might have to switch.
